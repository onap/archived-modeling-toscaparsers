tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_0

description: >
  This template is a test template which contains invalid input needed for substitution mappings.
  The required properties without default value in substituted node template which be mapped must be
  as inputs of nested service template which defines substutition mappings, and the inputs of nested
  service template which are not in the properties of the substituted node template must provide
  default values.
  This template provides an additional input of server_port1/my_cpus/my_input which are not defined
  in example.QueuingSubsystem, and the default value are 8080/2/123, all of these are right. But the
  required property of server_port defined in example.QueuingSubsystem is not appeared in inputs
  definiton, so will raise excepton of "MissingRequiredInputError".
